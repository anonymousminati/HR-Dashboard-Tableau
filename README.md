# HR Tableau Project Dashboard
A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Data and Material used

#### Project Data
  The data used in this HR Dashboard project is generated using a combination of ChatGPT prompts and the Python Faker library. This dataset simulates a set of employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The generated data is designed to mimic real-world HR data, providing a rich dataset for analysis and visualization in Tableau.
#### Icons & Images 
  The icons used in the HR Dashboard are sourced from Flaticon and customized using Photopea to match the dashboardâ€™s color scheme. The PDS (Photopea files) can be found in the icon folder of the zip file for further editing if needed.
#### Mockups 
  The initial dashboard mockup was created using the Procreate app on a tablet. Additionally, the dashboard container mockups were created using draw.io.
#### Tableau Project File 
  The project file created during the course can be found in Zip file. You can also directly download the Tableau file from my Tableau Public Profile.
## Summary View
  The summary view should be divided into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis

- ### Overview
    - Display the total number of hired employees, active employees, and terminated employees.
    - Visualize the total number of hired and terminated employees over the years.
    - Present a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles.
    - Compare total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ)
    - Show the distribution of employees by city and state.
- ### Demographic
    The Demographics section should offer insights into the composition of the workforce, including:

    - Present the gender ratio in the company.
    - Visualize the distribution of employees across age groups and education levels.
    - Show the total number of employees within each age group.
    - Show the total number of employees within each education level.
    - Present the correlation between employeesâ€™s educational backgrounds and their performance ratings.


- ### Income
    The income analysis section should focus on salary-related metrics, including:

    - Compare salaries across different education levels for both genders to identify any discrepancies or patterns.
    - Present how the age correlate with the salary for employees in each department.
   
## Data Generation

- ### Chat-GPT Prompts

    Generate python script to generate a realistic dataset of 8950 records for human resources. The dataset should include the following attributes:
    
        1. **Employee ID**: A unique identifier.
        2. **First Name**: Randomly generated.
        3. **Last Name**: Randomly generated.
        4. **Gender**: Randomly chosen with:
            - 46% probability for â€˜Femaleâ€™
            - 54% probability for â€˜Maleâ€™
        5. **State and City**: Randomly assigned from a predefined list of states and their cities.
        6. **Hire Date**: Randomly generated with custom probabilities for each year from 2015 to 2024.
        7. **Department**: Randomly chosen from a list of departments with specified probabilities.
        8. **Job Title**: Randomly selected based on the department, with specific probabilities for each job title within the department.
        9. **Education Level**: Determined based on the job title, chosen from a predefined mapping of job titles to education levels.
        10. **Performance Rating**: Randomly selected from:
            - â€˜Excellentâ€™
            - â€˜Goodâ€™
            - â€˜Satisfactoryâ€™
            - â€˜Needs Improvementâ€™
        with specified probabilities.
        11. **Overtime**: Randomly chosen with:
            - 30% probability for â€˜Yesâ€™
            - 70% probability for â€˜Noâ€™
        12. **Salary**: Generated based on the department and job title, within specific ranges.
        13. **Birth Date**: Generated based on age group distribution and job title requirements, ensuring consistency with the hire date.
        14. **Termination Date**: Assigned to a subset of employees (11.2% of the total) with specific probabilities for each year from 2015 to 2024, ensuring the termination date is at least 6 months after the hire date.
        15. **Adjusted Salary**: Calculated based on gender, education level, and age, applying specific multipliers and increments.
